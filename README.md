👋 Hi, I'm Harrison Prewett!

OSINT nerd, Geospatial Data Specialist, and Imagery Analyst with experience in AI/ML. I build efficient pipelines, automate imagery analysis, and work with tools like GDAL, Rasterio, and QGIS to transform and analyze complex spatial datasets.

🔍 What I do:

Develop custom solutions for geospatial data processing
Automate workflows using Python and open-source libraries
Deliver AI-powered insights through cross-functional projects
🌱 Open to new opportunities! I’m looking to bring my geospatial expertise and passion for Python development to my next challenge. Let’s create something impactful together!
