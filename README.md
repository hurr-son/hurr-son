### Hi there! I'm glad you're here.

I began my journey into tech in 2022 with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), discovering not just my capability for coding but also the joy and satisfaction it brings. I started with frontend web development, but during my 16 months at RAIC Labs, an AI startup, I transitioned into Python programming and computer vision, delving into geospatial data analysis and workflow automation.

This experience taught me that growth has no limits. As Justin Kan says:  
*"It's not where your Y-intercept is that matters, it's your slope of learning."*

Now, I’m planning to get back into web development, focusing on **Node.js** to expand my backend expertise and build even more robust applications.
